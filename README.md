# Home-Automation-Using-ESP32
Welcome to my Home Automation project using ESP32! This repository contains the code and documentation for building a fully-connected smart home system. With this project, you'll be able to control your home appliances using a smartphone or computer, as well as manual buttons.
ESP32 based 4 Channel IOT Home Automation using ESPRAINMAKER Application. Can be controlled using Physical switch as well as virtual buttons on the ESPRAINMAKER app. Works with or without internet connection using Manual Switches and WiFi connectivity with real time device status on the app.

## About Smart Home Automation

When we think of home automation we generally visualize switching on/off some buttons, temperature monitoring, etc.

> It is not smart automation in true sense

- To achieve true home automation Real Time Operating System (RTOS) is integrated in the system which can perform multiple things simultaneously.
- The system is smart enough to automatically trigger actions based on certain events happening in real time.
